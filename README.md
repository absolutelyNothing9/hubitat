Some various hubitata integrations.

Luton Aurora Dimmer.
  Within the Lutron Folder, then the New Version Folder, there are two files.
  One adds 6 schedules based on sunrise/sunset offsets and gives you the option to add different temperatures for the lights for each part of the day. It also adds occupancy to the sensors that listens
  to motion sensors in your hubitat system. Interacting with the lutron will update the occupancy as well. There are settings for how long without motion that the lights should go off. 
  
  The second, With Audio, listens for a double press of the button within two seconds (which delays the single button press), which then switches into audio control mode, which you can link to 
  a music player in your hubitat system. The button will now function as play/pause and the dimmer as volume level. Another double-tap will get you back to light settings.
